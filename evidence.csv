network.","This script contacts the remote DHCP server (if any) and attempts to
retrieve information about the network layout. 

Some DHCP servers provide sensitive information such as the NIS domain
name, or network layout information such as the list of the network
web servers, and so on. 

It does not demonstrate any vulnerability, but a local attacker may
use DHCP to become intimately familiar with the associated network.","Apply filtering to keep this information off the network and remove

this to route packets through the host and potentially bypass some
firewalls / routers / NAC filtering.

Unless the remote host is a router, it is recommended that you disable
IP forwarding.","On Linux, you can disable IP forwarding by doing :

echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

On Mac OS X, you can disable IP forwarding by executing the command :

sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=0

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

  - Possible request smuggling in mod_proxy_ajp: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request
    Smuggling') vulnerability in mod_proxy_ajp of Apache HTTP Server allows an attacker to smuggle requests to
    the AJP server it forwards requests to.  This issue affects Apache HTTP Server Apache HTTP Server 2.4
    version 2.4.53 and prior versions. Acknowledgements: Ricter Z @ 360 Noah Lab (CVE-2022-26377)

  - Read beyond bounds in mod_isapi: Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier on Windows may read beyond bounds
    when configured to process requests with the mod_isapi module.  Acknowledgements: The Apache HTTP Server
    project would like to thank Ronald Crane (Zippenhop LLC) for reporting this issue (CVE-2022-28330)

  - Read beyond bounds via ap_rwrite(): The ap_rwrite() function in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may
    read unintended memory if an attacker can cause the server to reflect very large input using ap_rwrite()
    or ap_rputs(), such as with mod_luas r:puts() function. Acknowledgements: The Apache HTTP Server project
    would like to thank Ronald Crane (Zippenhop LLC) for reporting this issue (CVE-2022-28614)

  - Read beyond bounds in ap_strcmp_match(): Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may crash or disclose
    information due to a read beyond bounds in ap_strcmp_match() when provided with an extremely large input
    buffer.  While no code distributed with the server can be coerced into such a call, third-party modules or
    lua scripts that use ap_strcmp_match() may hypothetically be affected. Acknowledgements: The Apache HTTP
    Server project would like to thank Ronald Crane (Zippenhop LLC) for reporting this issue (CVE-2022-28615)

  - Denial of service in mod_lua r:parsebody: In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier, a malicious request to a
    lua script that calls r:parsebody(0) may cause a denial of service due to no default limit on possible
    input size. Acknowledgements: The Apache HTTP Server project would like to thank Ronald Crane (Zippenhop
    LLC) for reporting this issue (CVE-2022-29404)

  - Denial of Service mod_sed: If Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 is configured to do transformations with mod_sed in
    contexts where the input to mod_sed may be very large, mod_sed may make excessively large memory
    allocations and trigger an abort. Acknowledgements: This issue was found by Brian Moussalli from the JFrog
    Security Research team (CVE-2022-30522)

  - Information Disclosure in mod_lua with websockets: Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may return lengths
    to applications calling r:wsread() that point past the end of the storage allocated for the buffer.

It is, therefore, affected by
multiple vulnerabilities:

  - When doing HTTP(S) transfers, libcurl might erroneously use the read callback (`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`) to
    ask for data to send, even when the `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` option has been set, if the same handle
    previously was used to issue a `PUT` request which used that callback. This flaw may surprise the
    application and cause it to misbehave and either send off the wrong data or use memory after free or
    similar in the subsequent `POST` request. The problem exists in the logic for a reused handle when it is
    changed from a PUT to a POST. (CVE-2022-32221)

  - A type confusion issue was addressed with improved checks. This issue is fixed in macOS Ventura 13. An app
    may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges. (CVE-2022-32915)

  - When curl is used to retrieve and parse cookies from a HTTP(S) server, itaccepts cookies using control
    codes that when later are sent back to a HTTPserver might make the server return 400 responses.
    Effectively allowing asister site to deny service to all siblings. (CVE-2022-35252)

  - curl can be told to parse a `.netrc` file for credentials. If that file endsin a line with 4095
    consecutive non-white space letters and no newline, curlwould first read past the end of the stack-based
    buffer, and if the readworks, write a zero byte beyond its boundary.This will in most cases cause a
    segfault or similar, but circumstances might also cause different outcomes.If a malicious user can provide
    a custom netrc file to an application or otherwise affect its contents, this flaw could be used as denial-
    of-service. (CVE-2022-35260)

  - curl before 7.86.0 has a double free. If curl is told to use an HTTP proxy for a transfer with a non-
    HTTP(S) URL, it sets up the connection to the remote server by issuing a CONNECT request to the proxy, and
    then tunnels the rest of the protocol through. An HTTP proxy might refuse this request (HTTP proxies often
    only allow outgoing connections to specific port numbers, like 443 for HTTPS) and instead return a non-200

multiple vulnerabilities:

  - When doing HTTP(S) transfers, libcurl might erroneously use the read callback (`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`) to
    ask for data to send, even when the `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` option has been set, if the same handle
    previously was used to issue a `PUT` request which used that callback. This flaw may surprise the
    application and cause it to misbehave and either send off the wrong data or use memory after free or
    similar in the subsequent `POST` request. The problem exists in the logic for a reused handle when it is
    changed from a PUT to a POST. (CVE-2022-32221)

  - A type confusion issue was addressed with improved checks. This issue is fixed in macOS Ventura 13. An app
    may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges. (CVE-2022-32915)

  - When curl is used to retrieve and parse cookies from a HTTP(S) server, itaccepts cookies using control
    codes that when later are sent back to a HTTPserver might make the server return 400 responses.
    Effectively allowing asister site to deny service to all siblings. (CVE-2022-35252)

  - curl can be told to parse a `.netrc` file for credentials. If that file endsin a line with 4095
    consecutive non-white space letters and no newline, curlwould first read past the end of the stack-based
    buffer, and if the readworks, write a zero byte beyond its boundary.This will in most cases cause a
    segfault or similar, but circumstances might also cause different outcomes.If a malicious user can provide
    a custom netrc file to an application or otherwise affect its contents, this flaw could be used as denial-
    of-service. (CVE-2022-35260)

  - curl before 7.86.0 has a double free. If curl is told to use an HTTP proxy for a transfer with a non-
    HTTP(S) URL, it sets up the connection to the remote server by issuing a CONNECT request to the proxy, and
    then tunnels the rest of the protocol through. An HTTP proxy might refuse this request (HTTP proxies often
    only allow outgoing connections to specific port numbers, like 443 for HTTPS) and instead return a non-200
    status code to the client. Due to flaws in the error/cleanup handling, this could trigger a double free in
    curl if one of the following schemes were used in the URL for the transfer: dict, gopher, gophers, ldap,
    ldaps, rtmp, rtmps, or telnet. The earliest affected version is 7.77.0. (CVE-2022-42915)

  - In curl before 7.86.0, the HSTS check could be bypassed to trick it into staying with HTTP. Using its HSTS
    support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS directly (instead of using an insecure cleartext HTTP step)

    previously was used to issue a `PUT` request which used that callback. This flaw may surprise the
    application and cause it to misbehave and either send off the wrong data or use memory after free or
    similar in the subsequent `POST` request. The problem exists in the logic for a reused handle when it is
    changed from a PUT to a POST. (CVE-2022-32221)

  - A type confusion issue was addressed with improved checks. This issue is fixed in macOS Ventura 13. An app
    may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges. (CVE-2022-32915)

  - When curl is used to retrieve and parse cookies from a HTTP(S) server, itaccepts cookies using control
    codes that when later are sent back to a HTTPserver might make the server return 400 responses.
    Effectively allowing asister site to deny service to all siblings. (CVE-2022-35252)

  - curl can be told to parse a `.netrc` file for credentials. If that file endsin a line with 4095
    consecutive non-white space letters and no newline, curlwould first read past the end of the stack-based
    buffer, and if the readworks, write a zero byte beyond its boundary.This will in most cases cause a
    segfault or similar, but circumstances might also cause different outcomes.If a malicious user can provide
    a custom netrc file to an application or otherwise affect its contents, this flaw could be used as denial-
    of-service. (CVE-2022-35260)

  - curl before 7.86.0 has a double free. If curl is told to use an HTTP proxy for a transfer with a non-
    HTTP(S) URL, it sets up the connection to the remote server by issuing a CONNECT request to the proxy, and
    then tunnels the rest of the protocol through. An HTTP proxy might refuse this request (HTTP proxies often
    only allow outgoing connections to specific port numbers, like 443 for HTTPS) and instead return a non-200
    status code to the client. Due to flaws in the error/cleanup handling, this could trigger a double free in
    curl if one of the following schemes were used in the URL for the transfer: dict, gopher, gophers, ldap,
    ldaps, rtmp, rtmps, or telnet. The earliest affected version is 7.77.0. (CVE-2022-42915)

  - In curl before 7.86.0, the HSTS check could be bypassed to trick it into staying with HTTP. Using its HSTS
    support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS directly (instead of using an insecure cleartext HTTP step)
    even when HTTP is provided in the URL. This mechanism could be bypassed if the host name in the given URL
    uses IDN characters that get replaced with ASCII counterparts as part of the IDN conversion, e.g., using
    the character UTF-8 U+3002 (IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP) instead of the common ASCII full stop of U+002E (.).
    The earliest affected version is 7.77.0 2021-05-26. (CVE-2022-42916)
