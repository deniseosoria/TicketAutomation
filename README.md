## Project Overview

The Ticket Automation Project is designed to enhance ticket management efficiency by automating parts of the process, especially for large teams managing complex workflows. The system:
- Reads and converts CSV data into JSON format for easier data handling.
- Interacts with JIRA using an API, updating tickets based on predefined criteria (e.g., risk level).
- Supports a straightforward configuration through environment variables.

## Features

- **CSV to JSON Conversion**: Quickly converts CSV files to JSON format, making data integration seamless.
- **JIRA Integration**: Uses JIRAâ€™s API to update tickets based on data-driven decisions.
- **Risk-Based Due Dates**: Sets ticket due dates according to risk levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
- **Flexible Configuration**: Environment-based configuration for secure API access.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ticket-automation.git
   cd ticket-automation

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:

 - **JIRA_EMAIL**: Your JIRA account email.
 - **JIRA_TOKEN**: Your JIRA API token.
     
   Example:

    ```bash
    Copy code
    export JIRA_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"
    export JIRA_TOKEN="your-token"

 3. **Prepare Data Files**: Ensure evidence.csv and assignees.json are present in the project directory.

##  Usage
  
   To run the automation, execute:
  
     ```bash
     Copy code
     python main.py
     This will:

1. Convert evidence.csv to evidence.json.
2. Authenticate with JIRA using the provided credentials.
3. Update JIRA tickets based on the information in evidence.json and assignees.json.

##  Configuration

- evidence.csv: Contains raw data that will be processed and converted into JSON format.
- assignees.json: Specifies the users responsible for different types of tasks.
